## 🧩 Projects

### 🔹 [GenAI RAG System](https://github.com/agonzalezp2/genai-rag-project)
Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline using **LangChain**, **AWS Bedrock**, and **Promptfoo**. Deployed on EC2, this solution includes prompt evaluation and vector search with FAISS.

### 🔹 WiredScore Analytics Lakehouse *(coming soon)*
Designed a centralized analytics architecture using **MS Fabric**, **Azure ADF**, and **Spark**. Improved efficiency and enabled client-facing metrics and retention KPIs.

### 🔹 Client Health KPI Metric *(coming soon)*
Developed a performance and retention score using engagement data across the user lifecycle. Helped commercial and product teams forecast client risk and success.

### 🔹 RubiCo Urban Mobility Analytics *(coming soon)*
IoT + geo-analytics project using smart cycling telemetry data to map urban infrastructure gaps. Built data pipeline and visual insights.

### 🔹 Natural Language Inference *(UCL)*
Analysed the performance of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, using the MultiNLI corpus. We evaluated various encoder types: LSTM, BiLSTM, BiGRU, Self-Attention, and **BERT**.


### 🔹 MSc Thesis: Spatiotemporal Causal Inference *(UCL)*
Causal modeling applied to geographic data over time. Focused on intervention effects and Bayesian inference.
